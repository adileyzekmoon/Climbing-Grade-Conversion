"# Climbing-Grade-Conversion" 

sgclimbingconversion.herokuapp.com

How to use:
1) You will be given 2 options of boulder grades available in Singapore, in the format {Climbing Gym} - {Grade}. 
2) Select the grade you believe generally has the harder routes, based on your experience. Should you be unable to make a decision due to lack of experience on that particular grade/gym, click skip.

Currently, the data isn't publicly available, but I wish to achieve at least 1000 datapoints before analysing the data.

Additional requests for features will be taken.

Current features in-the-works:
Pictures to represent grades (eg. coloured tags)
Visual representation of current data
